Collections of small sample extensions

## How to install

First, get yourself a version of tozti's core.
Then, copie the folder of the extensions you want to test inside the folder `extensions/` of the core.
Some extensions might require an extra step to be build. If it is the case, this step will be indicated inside the `readme` of the extension.
